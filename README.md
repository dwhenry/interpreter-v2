# interpreter-v1
Attempt to implement simple ruby interpreter

This is my first attempt at building an interpreter and
I have built most of it hand rather than using a tool 
(i.e. YACC). This is to try and improve my understanding
of how the internals of ruby work. 

I'm assuming it isn't anything like the code I am writing 
here, but my c is pretty rubbish so I have to start 
somewhere.
